*** Title : How Nmap really works// And how to catch it //Stealth scan vs TCP scan //Wireshark analysis
      - Stealth scan (half open) : nmap -sS: :SYN, SYN-ACK, RST          - Not recommend to use
      - Full connect scan        : nmap -sT  :SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, RST-ACK
      - Spot Nmap scans          : SMALL window size, Options contains only 1 option: Mss is small
      - Wireshark filter: There are 3 things we need to look for:
          - Small widow size                                        : (tcp.window_size_value == 1024) &&       
          - TCP header with "nothing going on" is about 20 bytes    : (tcp.hdr_len ==24) && 
          - SYN only                                                : (tcp.flags == 0x002) instead of tcp.flags.syn == 1 (SYN, and SYN-ACK will show)
