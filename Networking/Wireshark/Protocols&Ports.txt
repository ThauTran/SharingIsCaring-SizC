*** Title: The Top 15 Network Protocols and Ports Explained // FTP, SSH, DNS, DHCP, HTTP, SMTP, TCP/IP

When using Wireshark to look for those ports, use the PORT NUMBER instead of their names for FILTERING

TCP    21      - FTP   :File Transfer Protocol
                     +  Cleared text

                     + Send data in clear text
                            ~ Use FOLLOW THROUGH function in Wireshark to get the completed text
TCP    25      - SMTP  : Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
       586, 25, 465  + It can be encrypted or unencrypted
                     + Used TLS: Data will be encrypted

                     + Server (67), client (68)
                     + Wireshark: DHCP Discover, DHCP Offer, DHCP Request, DHCP ACK
UDP    69      - TFTP  : Trivial file transfer protocol
                     + Moving file, but more simple compared to FTP

                     + Data is sent in  clear text

                     + Send data in clear text
       995     - POP3 with TLS - Encrypted 
                     + TLS (Tranposrt Layer Security)
                     + Data sent is encrypted1
       110     - POP3 with NO TLS- Unencrypted              
       993     - IMAP  : Internet Message Access Protocol - Encrypted
                     + Secured with TLS
